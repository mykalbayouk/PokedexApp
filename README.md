# Pokedéx Recreation

## Description
This project is a recreation of the Pokedéx from the Pokémon series. It is a mobile application that allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID and view their details. The application uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokémon data.

Nearly every aspect of this app is clickable, including the Pokémon themselves, which will take you to a detailed view of the Pokémon. The detailed view includes the Pokémon's name, ID, type, abilities, stats and more. 

The current iteration of the app is meant only for mobile devices.
